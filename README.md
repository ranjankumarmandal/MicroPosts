About - This is a CRUD application, a full stack application. Technology used are HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap Bootswatch, Vanilla JavaScript, JavaScript ES6 modules, DOM Manipulation, Asynchronous JavaScript, Rest APIs, JSON Server, and some other technologies. Here I have created my own fake REST API using JSON Server.

Steps to run project locally -

1. Run frontend with webpack-dev server - npm run start
2. Run backend json-server - npm run json:server
